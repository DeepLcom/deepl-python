## [Unreleased]
### Added
<!-- * add to here -->
### Changed
<!-- * add to here -->

## [1.21.1] - 2025-03-12
### Added
* (beta) optional parameter to specify timeout for document translation calls

## [1.21.0] - 2025-01-15
### Added
* Added support for the Write API in the client library, the implementation
  can be found in the `DeepLClient` class. Please refer to the README for usage
  instructions.
### Changed
* The main functionality of the library is now also exposed via the `DeepLClient`
  class. Please change your code to use this over the `Translator` class whenever
  convenient.


## [1.20.0] - 2024-11-15
### Added
* Added `model_type` option to `translate_text()` to use models with higher
  translation quality (available for some language pairs), or better latency.
  Options are `'quality_optimized'`, `'latency_optimized'`, and  `'prefer_quality_optimized'`
* Added the `model_type_used` field to `translate_text()` response, that
  indicates the translation model used when the `model_type` option is
  specified. 


## [1.19.1] - 2024-09-17
### Fixed
* Fixed typing issues, black-formatting and a test case failure.


## [1.19.0] - 2024-09-17
### Added
* Added `billed_characters` to response from `translate_text()`.


## [1.18.0] - 2024-04-26
### Added
* New language available: Arabic (`'ar'`). Add language code constants and tests.
  Arabic is currently supported only for text translation; document translation
  support for Arabic is coming soon.

  Note: older library versions also support the new language, this update only adds new code constants.
* Added a section in the readme on how to configure retry options in `http_client.py`


## [1.17.0] - 2024-02-06
### Added
* Added `output_format` parameter for document upload function, that indicates
  the file extension of the desired file format for the translated document. 
* Added basic usage example of the library
### Fixed
* Fixed typechecking errors when using `mypy`'s `strict` mode
  * Thanks to [derlikh-smart](https://github.com/derlikh-smart) and [vad](https://github.com/vad) 
    for the report in [#82](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-python/issues/82)


## [1.16.1] - 2023-11-07
### Fixed
* Fixed typo in error message when no auth key is provided.
* Removed dependency on `packaging` by replacing version comparison.


## [1.16.0] - 2023-11-03
### Added
* Add optional `context` parameter for text translation, that specifies
  additional context to influence translations, that is not translated itself.
### Changed
* Added notice in Readme that starting in 2024 the library will drop support for
  Python versions that are officially end-of-life.
* DeepL API calls now send requests with JSON-encoded bodies where possible.
### Fixed
* Catch failures while constructing the user agent string.
* Added `py.typed` to the package so that our package is typed for our users.
* Fixed most type errors in the package.


## [1.15.0] - 2023-06-09
### Fixed
* Removed `CHANGELOG.md` and `SECURITY.md` from the python package. The `LICENSE` file is no longer installed, but still included in package tarball and wheel files.
  * Thanks to [TurtleWilly](https://github.com/TurtleWilly) for the report in [#66](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-python/issues/66).
* Fix a dependency error in our CI by updating to a higher poetry version in most cases.
* Fix getUsage request to be a HTTP GET request, not POST.
* Change document translation to poll the server every 5 seconds. This should greatly reduce observed document translation processing time.


## [1.14.0] - 2023-02-21
### Added
* Add [example](examples/json) to translate JSON inputs. 
* Added platform and python version information to the user-agent string that is sent with API calls, along with an opt-out.
* Added method for applications that use this library to identify themselves in API requests they make.
* Added `verify_ssl` option to `Translator` to control underlying `requests` session.
  * Thanks to [andrefloriani](https://github.com/andrefloriani) for the 
    suggestion in [#60](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-python/issues/60).

  Note: older library versions also support the new languages, this update only adds new code constants.
### Changed
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
* Copyright headers are updated for 2023
### Security
* Update `certifi` to resolve security advisory.

* Also send options in API requests even if they are default values.


## [1.11.0] - 2022-09-26
### Added
* Add formality options `PREFER_LESS` and `PREFER_MORE`.
### Changed
* Requests resulting in `503 Service Unavailable` errors are now retried.
  Attempting to download a document before translation is completed will now
  wait and retry (up to 5 times by default), rather than raising an exception.


## [1.10.0] - 2022-09-09
### Added
* New language available: Ukrainian (`'uk'`). Add language code constant and tests.

  Note: older library versions also support new languages, this update only adds new code constant.
